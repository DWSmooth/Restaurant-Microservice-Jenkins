# Jenkins build fork

This is a fork to work on building a jenkinsfile for maven project building and pushing to AWS

## Details

The jenkinsfile is on the /JenkinsDevWindows/ branch, and was last clocked at pushing the build after about 40 minutes from a local Jenkins server.
Running the same file on an EC2 instance with Jenkins made the instance bottom out its resources for an hour without finishing.
